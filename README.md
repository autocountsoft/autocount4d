# How Does Your Equipment Measure Up?

In today’s production environment, managers require up to the minute production data to identify patterns to maximize production and make data-driven decisions.

Both EFI’s Auto-Count and JDF-enabled equipment support this environment. While you may have some JDF equipment on your production fl oor, the non-JDF enabled equipment have valuable production data that may not be included in the production intelligence you have available today.
